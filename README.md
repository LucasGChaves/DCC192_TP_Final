# A RUFF QUEST

### 🎮 Description

**A Ruff Quest** is a top-down, 2D retro-style action RPG developed in **C++ using the SDL library**, targeting **PC platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS)**. Inspired by SNES-era classics like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana, the game features a charming pixel art aesthetic with 16x16 tiles and a fantasy medieval setting.
You play as an adventurer on a quest to rescue your loyal dog, who runs into a mysterious dungeon after hearing strange sounds coming from inside the cave.

The gameplay features a classic top-down view with 4-directional movement and real-time sword combat. The player has five lives and must defeat every enemy within the dungeon to win the game. A clean and informative HUD displays the remaining lives and score, which increases based on the number of defeated enemies.

Victory is achieved by clearing all enemies from the dungeon. The game ends in defeat if the player loses all lives.
