# A RUFF QUEST
**A Ruff Quest** is a top-down, 2D retro-style action RPG developed in **C++ using the SDL library**, targeting **PC platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS)**. Inspired by SNES-era classics like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana, the game features a charming pixel art aesthetic with 16x16 tiles and a fantasy medieval setting.

You play as an adventurer on a quest to rescue your loyal dog, who runs into a mysterious dungeon after hearing strange sounds coming from inside the cave.
